1.I downloaded and installed OpenJDK from the official website and configured the JAVA_HOME environment variable so that Java commands can be used from anywhere on the system.
2.To confirm that Java was installed correctly, I checked the installation by running thejava -version and javac -version commands, ensuring that both the Java runtime and compiler were working properly.
3.I manually created a basic project directory structure to gain a better understanding of how Java programs are organized at the filesystem level.
4.Using a simple text editor, I wrote a basic Java class and defined the main() method while following proper Java syntax rules.
5.I then compiled the Java source file using the javac compiler to generate the corresponding .class file.
6.Finally, I executed the compiled Java program using the java command and observed the output displayed in the terminal.
